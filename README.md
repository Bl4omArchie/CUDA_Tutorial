# CUDA_test
This is my repo test for CUDA. This language developped by Nvidia, allow you to compute with your GPU in purpose of accelerating your program (C/C++, python, java...)


## Installation of CUDA

You must have created an account on Nvidia website first.

Linux/Windows: https://developer.nvidia.com/cuda-downloads

Warning: if you are installing CUDA on ubuntu, you will be lead to those commands: 
``` 
wget https://developer.download.nvidia.com/compute/cuda/12.0.0/local_installers/cuda_12.0.0_525.60.13_linux.run*
sudo shÂ cuda_12.0.0_525.60.13_linux.run
``` 

if the second one doesn't work, you may use this one instead: sudo sh ./cuda_12.0.0_525.60.13_linux.run

Also, if you are using VS code, a few extension can be installed by typing Nvidia in the market place.
